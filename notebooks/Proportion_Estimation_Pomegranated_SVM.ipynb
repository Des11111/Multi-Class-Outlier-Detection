    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "I compare the `Normal()`,`Gamma()`in `pomegranate` package with three different OCC: SVM, IsolationForest, EllipticEnvelope\n",
    "1. The estimation error of proportions in unlabeled data using mixture model is much lower than that directly predict \n",
    "2. If we use `Normal()` to fit scores of training data but the size of one type of inliers among the training data is small(<50), the scores of training data is hard to fit a normal distribution, and raise error like: \" Variances must be positive \"\n",
    "3. But if we use `Gamma()` to fit scores of training data, it works when the size of one type of inliers is much smaller(almost 10)\n",
    "4. It works well in other OCC like Isolation Forest, EllipticEnvelope and I don't show these methods here"
